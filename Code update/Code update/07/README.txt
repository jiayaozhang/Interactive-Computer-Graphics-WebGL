Chapter 7 Programs:

bumpMap: bump map of a single square with a square "bump" in the middle and a rotating light

bumpMap2: bump map using 256 x 256 version of the honolulu data. One rotation moves the light source and the other rotates the single polygon that is bump mapped,

reflectingCube: similar to relectionMap but lets the user rotate the object instead of appearing to rotate the texture cube.

reflectingSphere: similar to relectionMap2 but lets the user rotate the object instead of appearing to rotate the texture cube.

reflectionMap: reflection map of a colored cube onto another cube rotating inside of it

reflectionMap2: reflection map of a sphere inside a cube.

texture3D3: 3D texture mapped to three orthogonal planes.

textureCube1: texture map of a gif image onto cube. Note some browsers such as Chrome will not allow the use of an external file as texture image. Program also displays the image on the right.

textureCubev2: texture mapping checkerboard onto cube

textureCubev3: texture map onto cube using two texture images multiplied together in fragment shader

textureCube4: texture map with two texture units. First applies checkerboard, second a sinusoid.

textureSphere1: GIF image texture mapped to sphere.

textureSphere2: Checkerboard texture mapped to sphere.

textureSquare: demo of aliasing with different texture parameters.
